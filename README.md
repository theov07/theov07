## About Me

I am a highly motivated quantitative researcher in training, focused on market microstructure, systematic trading, and derivatives pricing.  
I enjoy bridging **mathematics, stochastic modeling, and programming** to design and implement data-driven quantitative strategies.

- 💼 Exploring opportunities as a **Quantitative Researcher** or **Systematic Trading Analyst**.  
- 📚 Strong background in Python, C++, Monte Carlo methods, time-series analysis, and financial modeling.  
- 🚀 I work on projects involving **order book modeling, backtesting frameworks, option pricing engines, and execution-aware strategy design**.

## Education

- **Engineering Degree (EPF, France)** — Computer Science & Machine Learning (Top 3%)
- **MSc in Financial Engineering (Paris Dauphine – PSL)** — Quantitative Finance
- **Relevant coursework:** Probability & Statistics, Stochastic Processes, Financial Mathematics, Machine Learning, Time Series Analysis, Optimization

---

## Skills & Tools

- **Programming:** Python, C++, C#, SQL  
- **Quantitative Modeling:** Derivatives pricing, Monte Carlo simulation, variance reduction techniques, term structure modeling  
- **Market Microstructure:** L1/L2/L3 order book modeling, microprice signals, order flow analysis, inventory-aware market making  
- **Data & Infrastructure:** Event-time backtesting, high-frequency data processing, low-latency execution systems

---

## Projects

- **Multi-Asset Basket Option Pricing Engine (C#):**  
  Production-grade pricing engine for multi-asset derivatives combining analytical moment-matching (Brigo et al.) and Monte Carlo simulation with control variate variance reduction. Supports term structure modeling, full correlation matrices, and real market data integration (ECB €STR, Bloomberg volatility surfaces).
- **Trinomial Tree Option Pricer (Python):**  
  Implemented a trinomial-tree engine for European and American options with early-exercise handling and Greeks computation, validated against Black–Scholes convergence benchmarks.
- **GDP Nowcasting with MIDAS Regressions:**  
  Implemented and extended MIDAS models to forecast GDP using mixed-frequency financial data, with out-of-sample evaluation and lag/lead structure optimization in Python.
- **Algorithmic Trading & Backtesting Framework:**  
  Developed an event-time backtesting framework for systematic strategies (momentum, mean-reversion, market making), incorporating execution modeling and risk controls.
- **LSTM Stock Price Forecaster:**  
  Built a deep learning model for short-horizon financial time-series forecasting using LSTM architectures and feature engineering techniques.
